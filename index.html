        <h3 class="card-title">Where do users prefer to get their pets from? And what do they care about?</h3>
        <p class="card-text">I worked with my team to sketch out a research plan for interviews as well as write a survey for pet owners and those interested in pets. Most of our respondents adopted from a shelter and cared about an organization's mission and how they used their funds. They also wanted to feel connected to the mission.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Understandably, frustrations from ‘competitor’ organizations were largely around wondering where their money went and wanting more information about the animals at the shelter.</p>

        <img class="surveyPhotos" src="images/5interviews.png">
        <p class="card-text">We also did a deep dive into the site's information architecture to evaluate its content and where users might run into problems. Due to limited staffing, the shelter outsourced its pet information and donation processes, so users were sent to another tab on a third-party site to complete their tasks. In addition to the (joyful!) experimentation with typefaces, there was a lot of information about a rescue center in Alabama. With a little more research, I learned the shelter was the first of its kinds - rescuing animals from overcrowded shelters in Alabama and taking them to the Midwest where there is greater demand for adoption. It was especially important for us to highlight their incredible mission so users can also be impressed and inspired to support them.</p>

        <h3 class="card-title">Who are we catering to? What are we solving for?</h3>
        <p class="card-text">It became obvious through empathy mapping that our persona loves animals and cares a lot about if a nonprofit she adopts from or donates to uses its funds for its mission. Our user needed to feel connected with the organization's mission, trust them with their donations, and want to adopt from them. I facilitated a brainstorming session on ideas to meet these goals, from easy fixes to pie in the sky ideas. We then prioritized these features based on what was most important to the user and what was feasible for F&C.</p>

        <h2 class="sectionDisplay text-center">3. Ideation</h1>
        <h3 class="card-title">What does trust look and feel like?</h3>
        <p class="card-text">To get an understanding of what the user needed to feel that trust and connection, I led the team through iterations of storyboarding. We combined our best ideas that solved the user's natural skepticism. </p>

                    <li class="bullet2"><img class="icon" src="icons/arrow.png">Building an adoption survey widget that taught users what to expect from adoption</li>

            <div class="donationProcess">
                <ul>I focused especially on the donation process, where I brainstormed -

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="card-text">I then collaborated with team members on implicitly building trust through a new style guide inspired by the shelter's brand of warm, friendly service and the playfulness and joy that comes from the animals they save. We selected a color scheme that would evoke that feel, as well as a typeface and radius for cards that were rounded and playful to further connect the brand, and therefore give the user something to connect to. We also did a deep dive into the site's IA to evaluate its content and where our users might run into problems.</p>

        <h3 class="card-title">Validating (and invalidating) our decisions</h3>
        <p class="card-text">We decided to split up prototyping to generate more ideas faster. I focused on implementing our ideas from the donation flow through breaking up donation options onto cards, utilizing dropdowns, and a pop-up modal for completing donations on-site. I also wireframed the homepage and the 'about us' page, focusing on letting copy and images display the mission clearly and proudly.</p>
        <p class="card-text">We combined our ideas into one prototype. I looked for feedback from my team frequently on ideas and offered it as well to ensure we were being open and making the best product for our user and stakeholder.</p>
        <p class="card-text">I worked with my team to develop 3 tasks to test users on typical user pathways and tested 6 users. I focused specifically on testing our mobile prototype. </p>

        <p class="card-text">On a personal note, I really valued this project! Not only did I get to support a cause I am passionate about (as an owner of 3 adopted animals), I was able to work with 3 people who were dedicated to our task. They showed up to meetings with great ideas and feedback, and really pushed the bounds of what was possible within a short timeline. I'm so grateful to have worked with wonderful people on a great topic. Our final wireframes were received quite positively and I personally had several takeaways from this experience.</p>

        <p>There are still opportunities for this site to improve. I would love to get this in front of the stakeholder to get additional feedback. In addition, I'd love to add additional interactions to delight the user. In addition, I was challenged by the idea of making multiple, complex donation options simple. I would love to further iterate on what I created to make the process as simple and transparent as possible for the user.</p>
